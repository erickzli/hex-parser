/**
 * NOTE: This is a note explaining some project-wide params
 * \param cursor: this is a double pointer pointing to the current manipulating
 *   position to the data block.
 *   Q: Why a double pointer is needed for the cursor?
 *   A: Because by using double pointer, the program can track the cursor
 *     movement within the function even though we do not return the moved
 *     cursor.
 * \param jstring: this is a std::string in JSON format. It is for formatting
 *   the information from the data block, and then eventually return to the
 *   user for further manipulation. jstring will be written top-down following
 *   the order of the style symbol file.
 * \param level: this represents the indentation of the next jstring key-Value
 *   pair
 *   Example: if we state that the level is 3, the next jstring key-value pair
 *     will be indented with three tabs.
